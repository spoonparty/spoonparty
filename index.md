## Welcome to Spoon (because spooning is cute and we needed a name)

### What is Spoon?
Spoon is a sex-positive community in Edmonton, AB, founded on the idea that sex-positive culture flowers most readily in an environment of trust and shared values. For this reason, everyone who comes to Spoon is invited by someone else who has already attended, and is asked to understand, endorse and uphold our values before being included. Spoon is special because of the great care we take to create a safe and comfortable environment. There are a few basic ideas that guide how we shape our space:


#### Sex Positivity
We believe that consensual sexual expression is fundamentally good, and is the right of every human being who chooses to claim it. We believe sexuality is not inherently shameful, harmful or immoral, and is no better or worse than the pleasure, joy and fulfillment it produces.

#### Consent and Autonomy
These values are two sides of the sex-positive coin. Consent means that we believe what happens to, on, in or under our own bodies is entirely up to us. Autonomy means we believe what happens to, on, in or under anybody else's body is not up to us. Being part of the Spoon community means being OK with both of these.

#### Inclusivity and Exclusivity
We believe in inclusivity in that our space is open to anyone regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual taste, ethnicity, age (within reason), or any other morally irrelevant criteria. We are exclusive in that we believe that to create the safety and openness we want, we need to be surrounded only by people who are dedicated to consent and sex-positivity. For this reason, Spoon is not for everyone.

#### Environment and Community
The guiding premise of Spoon is that when people are allowed to be sexual in a safe and non-judgmental space, great things can happen. Spoon is not just about individual people trying to find other individual people to do sexy things with; it's about sex-positive community.

### How does it work?
Spoon events are usually much more chill than anyone expects them to be. Imagine a laid back house party, but without the usual taboo against having sex in front of the other guests. Everyone is free to hang out, socialize, and if you make a connection and want to pursue it, then great! We have a few practices that help keep things comfortable for everyone:

#### Opening circle
Everyone arrives to Spoon on time - there's no wandering in late. This means we can all have a good talk about consent and ground rules, get to know each other, and all start off on the same page.

#### Bracelets
We have three colours of glow bracelet for you to wear, red, orange and green. Wearing a red bracelet says, "I'm just here to talk and socialize, please don't ask me to do anything sexual."

An orange bracelet says, "I'm open to being approached, but I might need some time and space, or need to think about it, or talk to a partner, so please be patient."

A green bracelet (or no bracelet) says, "I am comfortable saying yes or no to anything, so ask whatever you like." You can switch off bracelets whenever you like, or wear the same one the entire night. Needless to say, no number of green bracelets is ever a substitute for explicit consent.

#### Support
Every event has support people on hand in case you need help, guidance, or just a safe person to talk to.

#### Sobriety
Moderate amounts of alcohol and marijuana (smoked outside) are welcome at Spoon, but intoxication and harder drugs are not, for everyone's comfort and safety.

#### The Space
Spoon usually happens in a private home, with a central hangout area, open bedrooms, and one private space. That means you have a place to go if you want to sit around and chat, places to go to have sex or watch, and a place to sneak away to if you and your friend just want to be alone.

Areas that can be used for sex will have sheets on them. There will be plenty of towels around, but you will need to bring your own safer sex supplies (condoms, dental dams, lube, gloves, squirt sheets, etc).

### Why would I come?
To meet other cool sex-positive people.

To be in a space where sex-positive values are the norm.

To do sexy things with people you know in a sexy environment.

To try out sexy things with people you don't know in a consent-focused and safe space.

To watch other people have sex.

To just hang out.

### So, is this like a kink play party?
Yes and no. Spoon was started, in part, because there are tons of places to go openly do kinky stuff, but not a lot of places to go openly have sex. At Spoon, therefore, we tend to focus on sex. We recognize that kink is an inalienable part of sex for lots of people, and kink is entirely welcome. We just encourage people to be conscious of how much physical and psychological space that their kink activities might take up.

### What do I need to do to come?
If you've never come to Spoon before, you'll need to have a chat with the organizers to make sure you understand how it works and that it is a good fit for you. This isn't a job interview - relax - but it's an important part of our feeling of community that everyone knows that everyone else is on the same page. This is also a good time to ask any additional questions you might have.

### Can I bring my friend/spouse/lover?
Probably, but they will be asked to go through the same intake process as you. Nobody gets an automatic plus one, so please ask first. It's also possible that Spoon might be right for you and not right for your partner; if that's the case, what you decide to do is up to you.

### What should I bring and wear?
Some people come in costumes, some people in lingerie, some in jeans and a t-shirt, and some people get naked in the first five minutes. No matter what you wear, you'll have a hard time standing out too much. Whatever you wear, show up in socially acceptable street clothes so that we don't attract too much attention, and change when you arrive.

We provide a space, soft things to lie on, and snacks. Please feel free to bring your favourite brands of safer sex equipment, toys, and booze in moderation. If you tend to be messy, bringing a waterproof blanket can be prudent.

### Photo/social media/privacy policy
For the safety and privacy of all party attendees, Spoon is a strictly no photo/no recording event (even in the social spaces). We acknowledge that people might have to have their phones with them during the evening, but cameras and phones are not allowed in any of the play spaces. We want you to feel comfortable being in a sexual space without having to think about your sexual activities possibly being recorded or shared online in the future.

As well, please do not post/share details or personal information of people who have attended the party. Who attended the party and what happened at the party stays at the party.

### Serious stuff
Spoon tries our very best to prevent bad things from happening before they start. But it isn't always possible to do that. The following are our policies on what happens if things go wrong - because it's better to have them up front where everyone can see them.

If you are hurt, unsettled or violated by anything that happens, please let a support person or organizer know. Anything you report will be taken very seriously.

It is possible that an organizer or support person may ask you to leave. If you are asked to leave, please do so quickly and quietly. Being asked to leave is not a judgement of your behaviour or your character; the organizers will prioritize the safety of someone who says they have been hurt before doing any work to investigate what happened.

If you are asked to leave, or if you are uninvited from Spoon, the organizers will work together to try to find a path of reconciliation, rehabilitation and re-entry into the community. We do not promise that we will succeed. Everyone has the right to be treated fairly and honestly by the community, but nobody has the irrevocable right to be part of it. The lasting, pervasive and unequal nature of sexual trauma in our society means we will make the best choices for the community - and for people who are harmed - first.

If an Spoon organizer is asked to step down by any member of the community, they will immediately do so and give up all organizing responsibilities until all other organizers decide by consensus to allow them back.

### Slightly less serious stuff
Sexual harm is real, pervasive and serious; but not all things that might make you feel bad at Spoon are necessarily sexual harm. There are two situations in which organizers will not intervene on your behalf.

If you do not want someone to be at the event, not because they have violated the rules or values of Spoon, but because they are your roommate or your ex or your sister or your graduate supervisor or because you just do not like them, we will not help you adjudicate who should come and who should leave.

If someone is doing something consensually sexual with their own body, or with the bodies of other consenting people, and what they are doing makes you uncomfortable, we will not ask them to stop. We will give you love and support and help you find a comfortable and safe space instead.
